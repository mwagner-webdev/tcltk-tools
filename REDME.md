This is a place to collect all the useful Tcl and Tk scripts that I have written myself and that I have come across in the [Tcl Wiki](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) and elsewhere, or which I found on my hard disk somewhere. Sometimes the code needed a few fixes, which are already applied here.

Unless otherwise noted, the license in `license.terms` applies. It is the same as the Tcl Core license.
